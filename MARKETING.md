# Molt Alert 🦞 - Marketing Kit

## 📰 ARTIGO DE LANÇAMENTO (Medium/Twitter Thread)

### I Built an AI That Watches Tokens Molt. Yes, Like a Lobster.

This is either going to change how degens trade pump.fun or be completely forgotten by tomorrow. I genuinely don't know which.

I'm launching **Molt Alert** - a real-time migration tracker that monitors every token's bonding curve on pump.fun and tells you exactly when it's about to "molt" (migrate to Raydium).

**Why Molt?**

If you've never kept lobsters (why would you), here's a fun fact: they shed their entire shell to grow bigger. It's called molting. The old shell cracks open and a bigger, more powerful lobster emerges.

That's exactly what happens when a pump.fun token migrates to Raydium. The bonding curve fills up, the shell cracks, and suddenly you've got a real token with Raydium liquidity and actual volume.

The problem? Most people miss it. They're too busy watching charts or scrolling Twitter. By the time they notice a token migrated, it already pumped 10x.

**What Molt Alert Actually Does**

It's embarrassingly simple:

- Tracks every single pump.fun token in real-time
- Shows you the exact bonding curve percentage (0-100%)
- Highlights tokens in the "hot zone" (90%+) that could molt any second
- Alerts you when tokens actually migrate
- All free. All transparent. No alpha hoarding.

The backend connects to PumpPortal's WebSocket feed and calculates the bonding curve from on-chain data. No guessing. No vibes. Just math.

**Why I Built This**

I've been trading pump.fun for months. I've caught some good migrations. I've missed more.

The frustrating part? The data is all there. It's on-chain. Anyone can see how full a bonding curve is. But there's no clean way to monitor everything at once.

I searched for a tracker. Couldn't find one I liked. So I built one over a weekend.

Is it perfect? No. Will it make you rich? Probably not. But will it help you see the molt coming before everyone else?

That's the experiment.

**What Could Go Wrong**

Honestly? A lot.

- The pump.fun API could change overnight
- Raydium migrations could get delayed or stuck
- I could mess up the bonding curve math
- Nobody might care

But that's why I'm shipping it live. If it breaks, you'll see it break. If it works, you'll see it work.

No private alpha groups. No "DM for access." Just a public tool that either delivers value or doesn't.

**What Success Looks Like**

If this works, you'll catch migrations earlier. You'll have more time to make decisions instead of panic buying after the fact.

If this fails, well, at least we'll have data on what doesn't work. And the lobster logo looks cool.

**Follow Along**

The site is live at molt-alert.vercel.app

I'll be tracking how many migrations it catches, how accurate the predictions are, and whether anyone actually finds it useful.

I'm nervous. I'm excited. I genuinely have no idea how this is going to go.

But I guess that's what makes it an experiment.

Watch the tokens molt with me. 🦞

## 📢 THREAD VERSION

1/

i built a thing 🦞

molt alert - a real-time migration tracker for pump.fun

it tells you exactly when a token is about to "molt" (migrate to raydium)

no more missing pumps because you weren't watching

2/

here's how it works:

every pump.fun token has a bonding curve
when it fills up (~85 SOL), it migrates to raydium
that migration usually = massive pump

molt alert tracks the % in real-time

3/

the UI shows:

🟢 normal tokens (0-70%)
🟡 hot tokens (70-90%)
🔴 about to molt (90%+)
✅ recently migrated

when a token hits 90%+ it could migrate any second

4/

why "molt"?

lobsters shed their shell to grow bigger
tokens shed pump.fun to grow on raydium

same energy 🦞

5/

it's free. no alpha group. no paid tier.

just a public tool because i got tired of missing migrations

try it: [LINK]

lmk if it's useful or garbage
